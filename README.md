# MediatR - Deno

## Summary

This is a shot at porting the great interfaces and classes done by [jBogard's MediatR](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR) into the Deno runtime.

Why do you ask? Because the Mediator pattern implemented by those interfaces is handy and help us keep focus on separating responsibilities. 

_Also because I needed a reason to dig into MediatR's source code 🤷‍♂️_
